Installation
------------

There are few ways to install geolocate in your system, but before any of them
you have to check your system has some application geolocate depends on:

 - **Wget**: It's a console downloader found by default in many linux
 distributions. I plan to remove this dependency using python libraries, but
 until that happens you should check your system has wget tool installed. *HINT:*
 Try "wget -h" in your console to see if you already have it installed.
 - **Gunzip**: It's a file decompressor for .gz files. It's used to open database
 files downloaded from Maxmind's website. I plan to remove this dependency using
 python libraries, but until that happens you should check your system has gunzip
 tool installed. *HINT:* Try "gunzip -h" in your console to see if you already
 have it installed.
