    "This program accepts any text and searchs inside every IP
    address. With each of those IP addresses,
    ${app} queries
    Maxmind GeoIP database to look for the city and
    country where
    IP address or URL is located. Geolocate is designed to be
    used in console with pipes and redirections along with
    applications like traceroute, nslookup, etc."
