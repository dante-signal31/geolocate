geolocate
================
This program accepts any text and searchs inside every IP address. With
each of them geolocate queries Maxmind GeoIP database <http://www.maxmind.com>
to look for the city and country where IP aor URL is located.

Geolocate is designed to be used in console with pipes and redirections along
with applications like traceroute, etc.

Geolocate's output is the same text than input but each IP is going to
have appended its country and city.
